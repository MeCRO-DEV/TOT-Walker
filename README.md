TOT-Walker JavaScript edition

This is a JavaScript version of TOT-Walker.

## TOT Coding
TOT Coding is a standard coding method used to capture the type of work performed, the amount of labor used, and the method to deliver it (dispatch or remote). It is an universal code based on SIS requirements that ca be used for all customers and in all ticketing systems. It provides consistency for SIS reporting requirements regardless of customer system or process, but it's not a replacement for normally required coding or updates.

TOT coding had been used by many large organizations such as SIEMENS, ATOS for long time. In order to avoid syntax error when writing TOT code, Thomas Brown created a tool called TOT-Walker which allows selection of proper code through drop down menus. Menus are translated into correct code which can be pasted into the correct field in the ticketing system. The original TOT-Walker was created on Windows XP; it is a native Windows XP application and it is obsolete in the Windows 10 era. This TOT-Walker is a re-implementation of original application; it is written in Javascript and HTML and can be hosted as a web page.
